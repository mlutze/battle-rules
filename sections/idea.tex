\section{Idea}

The principle properties the wargame rules should satisfy are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{itm:smooth} Gameplay should be simple and smooth;
        i.e., no calculations and few statistics to lookup during play.
    \item \label{itm:auto} Rules should be automatically derived from the situation,
        without the need for ad-hoc rule introductions for each situation in play.
    \item \label{itm:strength} Creature strength should be true to the stats of the individual creatures.
    \item \label{itm:scale} Rules should scale from smallish skirmishes to large battles.
\end{enumerate}

In order to address Goal~\ref{itm:smooth}, we separate the conversion into two parts:
the complex rules to convert a D\&D situation into a wargame situation (Section~\ref{sec:pregame}),
and the simpler rules to play the wargame (Section~\ref{sec:game}).
The conversion rules are pure mathematical calculations from creature statistics,
satisfying Goal~\ref{itm:auto} and Goal~\ref{itm:strength}.
Finally, we use parameters to scale statistics to an appropriate size for the situation,
satisfying Goal~\ref{itm:scale}.

The result is a system where each unit in the battle boils down to two numbers.
Very little math has to be performed during play,
to permit management of large battlefields
with minimal confusion.
