\section{Pre-gameplay}\label{sec:pregame}

Before a battle starts,
calculations are performed based on the participants' D\&D statistics.
There are 6 steps to the pre-gameplay calculation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Organize the participants into heterogeneous units.
    \item Gather the relevant statistics for each unit.
    \item Select general parameters.
    \item Calculate unscaled statistics for each unit.
    \item Select scaling parameters.
    \item Calculate scaled statistics for each unit.
\end{enumerate}
