\subsection{Calculate unscaled statistics}\label{sec:calculate-unscaled}

From the general parameters and the input statistics of the units
partaking in the battle,
we next calculate some \emph{unscaled} statistics.
These will be used to help select the parameters in in Section~\ref{sec:params}.
Specifically, the statistics we will calculate are:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n_*$ (health factor) -- a statistic indicating the total defensive power of a unit
    \item $d_*$ (attack factor) -- a statistic indicating the total offensive power of a unit as a proportion of its defense
    \item $e_*$ (space factor) -- a statistic indicating the total space taken by a unit
\end{itemize}
%

These statistics are calculated according to the following formulas:
%
\begin{align*}
    n_* &= hur^P \\
    d_* &= \frac{
        n d_a (10 + b_a)^P
    }{
        h r^P
    } \\
    e_* &= \sqrt{c^2 u}
\end{align*}
%
From these statistics, we calulate the following aggregate statistics:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n_\downarrow$ (minimum health factor) the minimum value of the health factor among all units
    \item $d_\rightarrow$ (median attack factor) the median value of the attack factor among all units
    \item $e_\downarrow$ (minimum space factor) the minimum value of the space factor among all units
    \item $u_\rightarrow$ (median unit number) the median number of creatures in a unit
    \item $p_\downarrow$ (minimum unit speed) the minimum value of the speed of creatures in a unit
\end{itemize}
