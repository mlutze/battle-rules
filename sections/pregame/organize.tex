\subsection{Organize}

The first step in preparing a large-scale battle is to organize the participants of the battle into heterogeneous units.
This means that each unit in the battle, which will have one collective turn,
must be made up of creatures with identical attributes and equipment.
Units do not need to be of identical size when compared with each other;
a battle may involve one unit of 50 orcs and another of 100 orcs.
However, the system works best when there are not orders of magnitude
of difference in strength among the units.
For example, many units of ten frogs against a tarrasque
may not be a usable setup for a battle;
instead the frogs should be organized into larger units
that would not be totally insignificant adversaries.
