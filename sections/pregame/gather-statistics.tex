\subsection{Gather Statistics}

The next step is to gather the relevant statistics
for each unit involved in the battle.
The required statistics are summarized below,
each with an associated symbol,
to be used in calculations in Section~\ref{sec:calculate-unscaled} and Section~\ref{sec:calculate-scaled}.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $h$ (creature health) -- the maximum hitpoints of a single creature
    \item $r$ (creature AC) -- the AC of a creature
    \item $d_a$ (attack damage) -- the average damage done by attack $a$
    \item $b_a$ (attack bonus) -- the to-hit bonus of attack $a$
    \item $n_a$ (normal range) -- the normal range of attack $a$
    \item $l_a$ (long range) -- the maximum range of attack $a$
    \item $u$ (unit size) -- the number of creatures in the unit
    \item $c$ (creature size) -- the length of a tile that a creature occupies
        (e.g., 5 feet for a medium creature)
    \item $p$ (creature speed) -- the movement speed of a creature
\end{itemize}
%
Some statistics are subscripted, such as $d_a$.
These are per-attack statistics.
A unit with both a sling attack and a sword attack
would have both a $d_\textsf{sling}$ statistic
and a $d_\textsf{sword}$ statistic.
