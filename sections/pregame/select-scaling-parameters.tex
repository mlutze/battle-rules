\subsection{Select scaling parameters}

The parameters are used to scale the battle to an appropriate size.
They control the damage done by attacks,
the health of units in the battle,
and the scaling of the board size,
in turn affecting the duration of the battle.
The parameters are summarized below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ (attack scalar) -- roughly indicates how much damage is required to reduce a unit's health by one point
    \item $H$ (health scalar) -- indicates how many points of creature health (without armor) are equal to one point of unit health
    \item $F$ (fraction attacking) -- the proportion of a unit that is attacking on a turn
    \item $G$ (grid size) -- the number of feet represented by the edge of a grid tile
\end{itemize}

These parameters can be selected via the previously chosen meta-parameters and unscaled statistics:

\begin{align*}
    H &= \frac{n_\downarrow}{10^P N} \\
    A &= \frac{d_\rightarrow H}{D} \\
    F &= \sqrt{u_\rightarrow} \\
    G &= \min(e_\downarrow, \frac{p_\downarrow A}{12 H F})
\end{align*}
