\section{Gameplay}

Gameplay proceeds generally similarly to combat in D\&D 5e:
Each round consists of each unit taking a turn.
On its turn,
a unit may either:
\begin{itemize}
    \item move and attack
    \item move twice
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Movement}
A unit may move a number of squares up to its speed ($m$).
If a unit leaves the set of squares adjacent to an enemy,
it draws an attack of opportunity from that enemy
even if that enemy has already made an attack of opportunity this round
(there is no ``reaction tracking'').

\subsection{Attacking}
An attack is made by rolling a number of dice equal to the unit's current dice pool ($n$),
which also represents its health.
For each roll greater or equal to the attack target number $t_a$,
the attack deals one damage,
reducing the target's dice pool by one die.
